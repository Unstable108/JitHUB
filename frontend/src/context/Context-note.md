`What’s Going On in Context (Detailed Explanation)`

The Context API in your authContext.js is used to manage global authentication state. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

Creating the Context:

createContext({}) creates a context object (AuthContext) with an empty default value. This context will hold the authentication state.


Custom Hook (useAuth):

The useAuth hook uses useContext(AuthContext) to access the context’s value (currentUser and setCurrentUser).
This makes it easy for any component to consume the auth state, e.g.:
jsxconst { currentUser } = useAuth();



AuthProvider:

The AuthProvider component wraps the app and provides the context value.
It uses useState to manage currentUser, initially set to null.
On mount, useEffect checks localStorage for a userId and updates currentUser if found.
The value object ({ currentUser, setCurrentUser }) is passed to AuthContext.Provider, making it available to all child components.


How Components Use It:

In Routes.jsx, useAuth retrieves currentUser and setCurrentUser to check if a user is logged in and manage redirects.
Other components (e.g., Profile, Dashboard) can use useAuth to display user-specific data or trigger login/logout actions.
